                <h2> All About Me! </h2>
                    <p1> I was born in Utah, but my journey has taken me through several places that have shaped who I am. 
                        <br> From the sunny beaches of San Diego to the quieter pace of Granite Bay, each move brought new
                        <br> challenges and experiences. Now, I’m heading to Chico, where I’ll be spending the next four years 
                        <br> working toward a degree in mechanical engineering — a goal that’s been fueled by both personal passion
                        <br> and resilience.
                    </p1>

                    <p2>Growing up, I was a competitive gymnast, constantly pushing my body and mind to new limits.
                        <br> That same drive shows up in everything I do, whether it’s editing videos, baking something from scratch,
                        <br> playing baseball or basketball, or just laughing with friends. But a couple of years ago,
                        <br> everything changed when I got really sick. Recovery has been long and difficult, 
                        <br> and it set me back in more ways than I expected. Still, that experience taught me a lot about patience, 
                        <br> strength, and what it means to keep moving forward even when things don’t go as planned.
                     </p2>

                     <p3>Now, I’m looking ahead with more purpose than ever. I want to earn my engineering degree and
                        <br> explore the world — especially through air shows, where creativity, design, and power come 
                        <br> together in the sky. My story so far hasn’t been perfect, but it’s mine, and I’m proud of 
                        <br> how far I’ve come.
                     </p3>
